# water-quality-analysis
Analysis of water quality data and visualization of key insights using Python and Power BI.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing water quality data, with the goal of generating actionable insights through data visualization. The analysis aims to highlight key indicators such as water contamination levels, safety thresholds, and geographical trends. The project also emphasizes the importance of data storytelling and visualization best practices, using Python and Power BI for deeper insights.

## Deliverables

1. **Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)**: The Python notebook containing all the data analysis and visualizations.
2. **Power BI Dashboard**: A dashboard created using Power BI to present key insights on water quality.
3. **Presentation (PPT)**: A PowerPoint summarizing the results, including the most relevant data visualizations and findings.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/laraS17/water-quality-analysis.git
